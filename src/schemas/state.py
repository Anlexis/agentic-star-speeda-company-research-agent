"""AgentCore Platform v1.0 - CMN-C2-287 SPEEDA Company Research Agent state."""

# State must be a flat TypedDict - never a Pydantic BaseModel.
# LangGraph checkpoints use msgpack serialization; Pydantic objects (and
# nested dict/list containers) are not msgpack-safe. Extend AgentState with
# agent-specific fields only, and declare every domain field NotRequired[...]
# (fields are absent until their producer node writes them). speeda_payload /
# speeda_config / redaction_flags are dicts/lists at the point of use but are
# stored in State as JSON strings via to_json/from_json below. Do NOT add
# credentials, secrets, or Pydantic models (PB-2 / PB-5). The SPEEDA
# integration token is NEVER stored here - it is read via ctx.secrets in
# CallSpeedaApiNode.
